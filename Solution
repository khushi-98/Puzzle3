Let's take a case where there is only one demon and one man, in this case demon will eat the man because there is no other demon there.
but when there is two demons then he will not risk his life.
When there are 3 demon then he can eat the man beacuse if rest of demon tried to eat him, then remaining one will eat them.
Similarly,when demon are 4,5 or 6 or more, no one tries to risk their life so only one will eat the sleeping one and rest will reamins same.
